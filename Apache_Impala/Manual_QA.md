# Welcome to the MindsDB Manual QA Testing for Apache Impala Handler

## Testing Impala Handler

**1. Testing CREATE DATABASE**

```
CREATE DATABASE impala_datasource
WITH
  engine = 'impala',
  parameters = {
    "user":"root",
    "password":"p@55w0rd",
    "host":"172.17.0.2",
    "port":21050,
    "database":"mindsdb"
  };
```

**2. Testing SELECT FROM Database**
    
    ```
    SELECT *
    FROM impala_datasource.employees;
    ```
![](select_local_impala.png)

**3. Testing In Mindsdb Cloud**

```
CREATE DATABASE impala_datasource
WITH
  engine = 'impala',
  parameters = {
    "user":"root",
    "password":"p@55w0rd",
    "host":'0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io',
    "port":11056,
    "database":"mindsdb"
  };

SELECT *
FROM impala_datasource.employees;
```
To do this step, you have to create a tunnel to your local machine using ngrok. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Create the tunnel using the command below:
```
ngrok tcp 21050
```
2. Then replace the host with the ngrok URL and the port with the port that ngrok creates.
